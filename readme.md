# Description

Blackjack is a card game where players compete against the house (casino) rather than each other.  

The objective is to get a hand total of 21 or as close to it as possible. The catch is the dealer's hand must be less than the player's in order to win. Be careful to not total more than 21 in a hand! Whoever does first... **YOU LOSE!**

# How do you beat the dealer?
1. By drawing a hand value that is higher than that of the dealer.
2. By the dealer drawing a hand that exceeds 21.
3. By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first hand dealt.

# How do you lose to the dealer?Â 
1. Your hand value exceeds 21.
2. The dealer's hand has a greater value than yours at the end of turn.

# Card Values!
* Numbered cards - Assigned same value as number provided
* Face cards - Any of (King, Queen, Jack) are assigned a value of 10
* Ace - Can hold value of 1 or 11 (player's choice given current state of hand)
